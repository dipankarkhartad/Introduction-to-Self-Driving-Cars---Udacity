# Introduction-to-Self-Driving-Cars-Udacity


I completed the course **Introduction to Self-Driving Cars nanodegree from Udacity**, improved my knowledge of Python and C++ in this program, used matrices and mathematics in my code, and used computer vision and machine learning to address challenges about self-driving cars. 
Among many other fascinating tasks, at the end of the course, I had constructed a traffic light classifier, Kalman filter, and rebuilt trajectories from sensor data. 

The tasks completed in the nanodegree are listed below

1. Joy Ride
2. 2D Histogram Filter in Python
3. Implement a Matrix Class in Python
4. Implement a Matrix Class in C++ with improved performance
5. Implement a Route planner 
6. Reconstructing Trajectories from Sensor Data
7. Traffic Light Classifier
